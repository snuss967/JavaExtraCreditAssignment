Welcome to my Hangman Game
This Game is extremely easy to build and run because we did not develop it in C.
Just open the game in Eclipse or your IDE of choice and select run HangMan or right click on the Hangman.java file under game data. 
If you really want to deal with JAVAC and JAVA in the command line be my guest. Im just not supporting it because that would be a dumbway to go about building this.

Instructions To Play:
1. Find Your Hangman Partner
2. Launch The Game By Running in in Your Favorite IDE
3. Make sure that the person that has the computer has the computer out of view of the other person
4. Enter a word of 22 characters or less
5. Save The Word
6. Play the game
7. Pass the Game to your opponent
8. Let them guess words they get 8 tries before they lose
9. Try not to complete the hangman object

Future ways that we can improve this project. 
We could let the user play hangman with whatever image they want we could split an image done 8 paths. 
Save game functionality. 
Refactoring the entire code for security. 

Good Luck!!!
